Android Button Generator is a tool for creating Android based multiple state buttons like pressed, selected situtations as files. 

It's first version and it's written in ~30 minutes for to help myself because of I got tired to creating buttons and each buttons require min 3 files and 1 more for selector file. 

I would to make a better tool maybe in the future.

I hope it helps.
