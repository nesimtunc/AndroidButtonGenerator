Android Button Generator is a tool for creating Android based multiple state buttons like pressed, selected situtations exporting as xml files. 

It's first version and it's been written in ~30 minutes for help myself because of I got tired of creating buttons and each buttons require min. 3 files and 1 more one for selector file. 

I would like to make a better tool. Maybe in the future.

I hope it helps.

Happy Coding
